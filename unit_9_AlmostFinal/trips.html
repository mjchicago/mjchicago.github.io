  <b>Brazil:</b><br>
  Globetrotter Travel's Brazil adventure includes an Amazon river cruise that will take you to a place so remote that you likely will not see anyone for days! You are likely to see, however, see gorgeous birds, pink dolphins, caimans, sloths, monkeys and if you are lucky, a snake or two. <br>
